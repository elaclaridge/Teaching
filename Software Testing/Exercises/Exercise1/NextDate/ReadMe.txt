Assessed Assignment 1
Problem 1
ReadMe file


A Visual Basic executable program BlackBox supports practice testing on three of the examples used in the book by Paul Jorgensen  "Software Testing : A Craftsman's Approach", 2nd Edition. There are faults inserted in the procedures used. The overall purpose is to test the problems, NOT (as Jorgensen's gleeful students enjoy) to test the Visual Basic support programs. The VB interface makes the programs fairly self-explanatory.

The BlackBox.exe program supports functional testing of the programs.  Since this is functional testing, you have no access to the source code.  BlackBox.exe runs a complete set (file) of test cases, and produces a file of test case execution results. 

'ExampleTestCasesNextDate.txt' is an example test case file. Use exactly the same format to define your own tests (BlackBox has a poor input parser which is sensitive to spaces between the data strings, positions of commas etc).

Enjoy!
