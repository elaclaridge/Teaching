
In fluorescence microscopy, the sample you want to study is itself the light source. The technique is used to study specimens, which can be made to fluoresce. The fluorescence microscope is based on the phenomenon that certain material emits energy detectable as visible light when irradiated with the light of a specific wavelength. The sample can either be fluorescing in its natural form like chlorophyll and some minerals, or treated with fluorescing chemicals.
The Sample Gets ExcitedThe basic task of the fluorescence microscope is to let excitation light radiate the specimen and then sort out the much weaker emitted light to make up the image. First, the microscope has a filter that only lets through radiation with the desired wavelength that matches your fluorescing material. The radiation collides with the atoms in your specimen and electrons are excited to a higher energy level. When they relax to a lower level, they emit light.
To become visible, the emitted light is separated from the much brighter excitation light in a second filter. Here, the fact that the emitted light is of lower energy and has a longer wavelength is used. The fluorescing areas can be observed in the microscope and shine out against a dark background with high contrast.
Specific Details are MarkedFluorescence microscopy is a rapid expanding technique, both in the medical and biological sciences. The technique has made it possible to identify cells and cellular components with a high degree of specificity. For example, certain antibodies and disease conditions or impurities in inorganic material can be studied with the fluorescence microscopy.
